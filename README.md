# gmod-linux-fix
Make the native GMod version playable. The only fix you'd ever need.

# Installation
Paste the following command in your terminal:
`wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wayzaction/gmod-linux-fix/refs/heads/main/gmod-linux-fix.sh && sh gmod-linux-fix.sh`

# Terminal Compatibility
Unfortunately, not every terminal supports this script, so you may be forced to manually execute GModCEFCodecFix.

Supported Terminals:

`x-terminal-emulator`
`xfce4-terminal`
`gnome-terminal`
`terminator`
`alacritty`
`konsole`
`kitty`
`xterm`
`urxvt`

# Thanks!
Thanks to @ret-0 and @Exotic0015, I refracted their script, because it was (partially) broken.
